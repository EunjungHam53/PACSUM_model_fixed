We evaluated machine translation performance for six European language pairs that participated in a shared task: translating French, German, Spanish texts to English and back  Evaluation was done automatically using the BLEU score and manually on fluency and adequacy Conclusions We carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance on European language pairs.
For our training and test data, we used the English-French subset of the Europarl corpus provided for the shared task (Koehn and Monz, 2006) at the Statistical Machine Translation workshop held in conjunction with the 2006 HLT-NAACL conference.
We are further focusing on the shared task of the workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, which took place last year (Koehn and Monz, 2006) and consisted of translating Spanish, German, and French texts from and to English.
