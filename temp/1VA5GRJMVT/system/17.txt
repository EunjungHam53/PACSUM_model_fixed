Finding Predominant Word Senses in Untagged Text Abstract word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed.
Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages, one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words, particularly topical words, to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration.
We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically.
