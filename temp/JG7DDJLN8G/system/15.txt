Cascaded Linear Model A Cascaded Linear Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging Abstract We propose a cascaded linear model for joint Chinese word segmentation and partof-speech tagging.
With a character-based perceptron as the core, combined with realvalued features such as language models, the cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to incorporate into the perceptron directly.
If this cascaded linear model were chosen, could more accurate generative models (LMs, word-POS co-occurrence model) be obtained by training on large scale corpus even if the corpus is not correctly labelled entirely, or by self-training on raw corpus in a similar approach to that of McClosky (2006)?
