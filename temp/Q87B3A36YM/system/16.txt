This paper describes the functioning of a broad-coverage probabilistic top-down parser, and its application to the problem of language modeling for speech recognition  The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling  A lexicalized probabilistic topdown parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers  A new language model that utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity  Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model  A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model Second, their language models were used to rescore n-best speech lists (supplied by Brian Roark; see Roark (2001)).
The perceptron approach was implemented with the same feature set as that of an existing generative model (Roark, 2001a), and experimental results show that it gives competitive performance to the generative model on parsing the Penn Treebank.
We implemented the perceptron approach with the same feature set as that of an existing generative model (Roark, 2001a), and show that the perceptron model gives performance competitive to that of the generative model on parsing the Penn Treebank, thus demonstrating that an unnormalized discriminative parsing model can be applied with heuristic search.
