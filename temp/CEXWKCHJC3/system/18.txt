Regarding the system combination study, Henderson and Brill (1999) propose two parser combination schemes: one that selects an entire tree from one of the parsers, and one that builds a new tree by selecting constituents suggested by the initial trees.
(Henderson and Brill, 1999) perform parse selection by maximizing the expected precision of the selected parse with respect to the set of parses being combined.
The resulting parsers surpass the best previously published performance results for the Penn Treebank.
