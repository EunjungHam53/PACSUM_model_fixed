find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.
CHARACTERIZING STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTIONS PRODUCED BY VARIOUS GRAMMATICAL FORMALISMS* Abstract We consider the structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms in terms of the complexity of the paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural descriptions that each system can generate.
We write REGD.k/ to refer to the class of regular dependency languages with a gap-degree bounded by k. Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems gap-restricted dependency languages are closely related to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS) (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987), a class of formal systems that generalizes several mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms.
