The difference between the JPLSA model and the polylingual topic model of (Mimno et al., 2009) is that we merge the vocabularies in the two languages and learn topic-specific word distributions over these merged vocabularies, instead of having pairs of topic-specific word distributions, one for each language, like in (Mimno et al., 2009).
Polylingual Topic Models Abstract Topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections, but have previously been applied in only monolingual, or at most bilingual, contexts.
We also demonstrated that relatively small numbers of topically comparable document tuples are sufficient to align topics between languages in non-comparable corpora.
