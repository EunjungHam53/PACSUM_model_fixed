A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classi- However, we show that the use of data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple &quot;seed&quot; rules.
Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification Collins Abstract This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification.
The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98).
