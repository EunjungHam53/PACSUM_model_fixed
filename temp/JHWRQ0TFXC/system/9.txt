An Annotation Scheme for Free Word Order Languages Abstract We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.
The parsing models we present are trained and tested on the NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1997), a hand-parsed corpus of German newspaper text containing approximately 20,000 sentences.
