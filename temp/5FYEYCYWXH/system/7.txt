A Maximum-Entropy-Inspired Parser * Abstract We present a new parser for parsing down to Penn tree-bank style parse trees that achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences of 40 and less, and for of length 100 and less when trained and tested on the previously established [5,9,10,15,17] &quot;standard&quot; sections of the Wall Street Journal treebank.
The major technical innovation is the use of a &quot;maximum-entropy-inspired&quot; model for conditioning and smoothing that let us successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events.
Conclusion We have presented a lexicalized Markov grammar parsing model that achieves (using the now standard training/testing/development sections of the Penn treebank) an average precision/recall of 91.1% on sentences of length < 40 and 89.5% on sentences of length < 100.
