Learning Dependency-Based Compositional Semantics Abstract Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms.
(2011) proposed DCS for dependency-based compositional semantics, which represents a semantic parse as a tree with nodes representing database elements and operations, and edges representing relational joins.
In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.
