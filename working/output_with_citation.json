Even in models that cannot e analytically solved, the tree model enales us to use efficient recursive numerical methods to get reliale numerical estimates of critical points and exponents This enales the so called pool method which simulates the distriution of density matrices at layer k from a pool of density matrices at layer k -1, allowing the efficient simulation of trees of large size. This ensures the efficient simulation of dynamics y the so called pool method a way to get the final distriution recursively. The method is exact in that, at every step, it preserves exactly the Green functions of the remaining set of Fock-space sites. Originally introduced y Aoki and later employed in other works on single-particle localisation this procedure was also implemented on the Fock-space graph in Ref. It yields the statistics of an effective, renormalised matrix element etween aritrary pairs of Fock-space sites at an energy scale \u03c9.",

The practical effect of this assumption is to count tau leptons only as electromagnetic energy and to require calculation of an effective hadronic ranching fraction for neutralinos decaying through a virtual photon, which tend to produce very soft q q pairs At early times, the 1 TeV limit is weaker y a factor of \u223c 5, which we can explain from the fact that the generic 1 TeV particle (which decays directly to q q) produces approximately twice as many aryons per decay as the 100 GeV particle (estimated from Figure 9 of We evaluate the freestreaming scale y the comoving Jeans scale at the matter radiation equality to find k J \u2243 2\u00d710 6 Mpc (m Ch /10 8 GeV) 1/2 (T /T Ch ) 1/2 , elow which we can ignore the free-streaming of CHAMP.",

If the gradients are instead normalised y the effective radius of galaxies ( e ) and expressed in dex  -1 e , some authors find that the MZGR is steepest around  \u2605 \u223c 10 10-10.5 M , with flatter gradients on either side (e.g., whereas others report a constant, characteristic dex  -1 e gradient for all galaxies with  \u2605 > 10 9.5 M 2018;However, these trends in the MZGR are relatively weak as compared to the MZR, suffer oservational and caliration uncertainties and to date, have received limited theoretical investigation. As shown y different calirations can lead to different values of metallicity, with discrepancies such as the one we encounter within the range of what is expected. Previous attempts to quantify this effect have employed either smearing of high spatial resolution oservations with coarser point spread functions (PSFs) or application of PSF convolution to model discs (Carton et al. 2017). Our work shows etter agreement with that of Yuan, who also find that coarser spatial resolution (or coarser annular inning) leads to flatter inferred gradients. We use the SFR-weighted Z, ecause it can e directly compared against availale MZRs since they are inherently sensitive to the SFR as the neular metallicities are measured in H regions around young stars These measurements make use of the same neular emission lines as used for metallicity measurements of other star-forming galaxies",

    "1334": ", we find that for gravitino masses above the Math_8 mass threshold antiprotons currently provide the strongest and most robust constraints on the gravitino lifetime . we presented strong limits on the lifetime of unstable gravitino dark matter and the strength of bilinear Math_4-parity violation derived from pamela antiproton data . an intriguing feature of this type of models is that decaying gravitino dm exhibits a rich phenomenology although the gravitino usually is thought to be one of the most elusive dm candidates . a tiny violation of Math_4-parity is sufficient to trigger the decay of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) before the time of bbn , thus maintaining the successful predictions of standard cosmology . Given the non-oservation of gravitino decay products, we will proceed to set limits on RPV couplings and will compare them to ounds coming from low-energy aryon-numer-violating processes (which are especially weak for couplings involving third generation fields). Although this has een studied in the literature, many groups have focused only on the ilinear RPV coupling \u00b5 i L i \u03c6 u with just Refs. discussing the trilinear interactions; weak scale supersymmetry was also frequently assumed. Providing a DM candidate is one of the strongest arguments in favour of RPC SUSY, nonetheless RPV models do exist that can explain DM through, for instance, very light gravitinos axions or axinos In parentheses are multiplicities reported y to which we compare. For example considers W and Z\u03bd final states with p + p multiplicities each of aout 1.6, and concludes a lower limit on the lifetime of aout 2 \u2022 10 for 100 GeV gravitinos (and roughly similar values up to the top mass). It has een shown in that in the limit of gravitino masses aove 1 TeV, the decay widths of the channels listed in 2.1, reach their asymptotic limit, The resulting gravitino lifetimes when the theoretical prediction on the BRs is included are lower than in the case with free BRs, they are in the range 5.9 -6.5 \u00d7 10 25 s, these lifetimes are excluded y the limits from antiproton measurements derived in The antiproton limits in cannot e directly applied to our results with free BRs, which provide etter description of the AMS-02 leptonic data, therefore in next sections we use gamma-ray measurements to proe those gravitino scenarios. We already knew that the scenarios with the restriction 2:1:1 on the BRs were excluded ecause the antiproton limits derived in On the other hand, the antiproton limits in cannot e directly applied to the gravitino scenarios with free BRs.

Math_7(c ) in the telescope beam can be uniquely determined regardless of source distribution .    table tab : quantity_ci clearly shows that all the detected c  i emission lines are optically thin . it should be noted that we assumed the optically thin condition ( Math_34}\\ll1 $ ) for lkca 15 and tw hya because no c  i emission was detected . we employed Math_45 for the pss because they were expected to be embedded in extended envelopes that extend over the beam area . for the ttss the double - peaked profile of dm tau lies close to the systemic velocity . after correcting for the beam size and efficiency , this is similar to the spectral shape of the co Math_1143 and other co transitions . In general, the detection statistics for C II are quite poor while C I (Fig. 11) has only een searched for in a handful of systems with moderate success While we are generally interested in the overall (steady-state) structure of the forming outflows, recent oservations of clumpy winds, for instance, in EX Lup also warrant a closer inspection of potential mechanisms that could produce time-variaility in the mass-loading of the launching mechanism and their susequent oservational signatures. In view of recent oservations of a clumpy outflow in EX Lup a closer study of this time variaility (which moreover modulates the mass loading of the wind) and its precise origin certainly appears warranted.",

And the value of the \u03c0 -/\u03c0 + ratio reflects the ratio of neutron numer and proton numer in dense matter, i.e., \u03c0 -/\u03c0 + \u2248 (N dense /Z dense ) 2 it is not surprising to see larger value of the \u03c0 -/\u03c0 + ratio in the collision of ule nuclei. Because the stiffer symmetry energy (\u03b3 = 1.5) causes more neutrons to emit from the formed dense matter in collision and the neutron-poor dense matter causes a small value of the \u03c0 -/\u03c0 + ratio as expected, one sees in Fig. 6 the value of \u03c0 -/\u03c0 + ratio with the stiffer symmetry energy (\u03b3 = 1.5) is smaller than that with the soft symmetry energy (\u03b3 = 0.3).",

In adsorption experiments, depending on the size of the gas reservoir connected to the experimental cell, the isotherms could in principle evolve from a 'grand-canonical' to a 'canonical' type There is also good numerical evidence that the same is true in three dimensions and we elieve that this is a general feature. Such a region, however, does not exist in the one-dimensional RFIM for which the quenched complexity has een computed analytically In this case, the driving force is the gas pressure in the external reservoir, the order parameter is the amount of adsored gas inside the solid, and temperature is just a parameter that changes the topology of the free-energy landscape (ut is still too low for making activated processes efficient and inducing rate-dependent hysteresis effects)",
